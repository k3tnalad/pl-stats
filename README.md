## Hi there 

So this is a just a desc of this little project I decided to rebuild from my past.
Initially it was done with just HTML, CSS and JS, no framworks or libraries included.

Currently, it's on Svelte. 

### What it is

* Shows current table standings in EPL
* Shows last 10 fixgures
* Shows best goalscorers

### Optional to-dos

- [] Split the thing into components
- [] Add footer with references
- [] Allow checking future fixtures and past ones
- [] Fetch data on match
